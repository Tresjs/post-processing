Post-processing, in simple terms, consist in applying visual effects to your 3D scenes after they have been rendered. It allows you to add beautiful effects such as depth-of-field, bloom, motion blur, and many more.

The `post-processing` package leverages both the excellent work done by the pmndrs [postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing) package and native [Three.js post-processing effects](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=postprocessing#webgl_postprocessing). Providing you with an easy-to-use, Vue-centric solution that makes the developer experience (DX) smoother and more delightful.

Post-processing used to be not an easy task, but fortunately, now it is. ðŸ˜œ

::: info
This package is not required to use with the core library, but it can make your DX significally better, specially for complex scenes.

### Using native Three.js effects

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { EffectComposer, UnrealBloom, Glitch } from '@tresjs/post-processing/three'
</script>

<template>
  <TresCanvas shadows alpha>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :args="[45," 1, 0.1, 1000] />
    <EffectComposer>
      <UnrealBloom />
      <Glitch />
    </EffectComposer>
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

### Using pmndrs effects

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { EffectComposer, Bloom, Glitch } from '@tresjs/post-processing/pmndrs'
</script>

<template>
  <TresCanvas shadows alpha>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :args="[45," 1, 0.1, 1000] />
    <EffectComposer>
      <Bloom />
      <Glitch />
